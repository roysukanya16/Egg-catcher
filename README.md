# Egg-catcher

In my project, I've developed an exciting Egg Catcher game using Python and the Pygame module. Players get to control a basket and have the task of catching falling eggs while carefully dodging dangerous bombs. With its colorful visuals and engaging gameplay, I'm confident it will offer an enjoyable and challenging experience, keeping players entertained for hours!
